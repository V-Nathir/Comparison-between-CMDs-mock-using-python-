Using a simple CMD-mock without knowing the SHF, generated by IAC-Star, I have generated a method to compare it with other mock CMDs to obtain the SFH.

A CMD-Reference (cmd-Low and cmd-High) is compared with different CMDs-tests until they are equal. Then, the SFH is recovered. 

The CMD is transformed into a mesh of cells such that it can be directly compared with another CMD.

A residual (remnant) and a reliability is calculated when two meshes, two CMDs, overlap. And it is post-processed.

The idea is to reduce these two parameters as much as possible.
